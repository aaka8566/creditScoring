## 🔄 How It Works (Simple Version)

```
1. Upload PDF/Image → 2. Extract Text → 3. Ollama AI Analysis → 4. Get Structured Data
```

**Example Flow**:

```python
# Your current code (main.py)
from scoring import hybrid_risk_score

application = {
    "age": 30,
    "income": 50000,  # Self-declared ❌
    "loan_amount": 500000,
    "employment_type": "Salaried",
    "credit_score": 720,
    "existing_debt": 100000  # Often underreported ❌
}

result = hybrid_risk_score(application)
```

**Enhanced with Bank Statement**:

```python
# New capability (bank_statement_api.py)
from bank_statement_processor import get_processor

# Process statement
processor = get_processor()
statement_data = processor.process_statement(file_content, 'pdf')

# Now you have verified data ✅
verified_income = statement_data['monthly_income_estimate']  # 48,500
actual_debt = statement_data['loan_emi_payments'] * 12       # 144,000
red_flags = statement_data['red_flag_analysis']['red_flags'] # [...]

# Enhanced scoring with verified data
result = enhanced_hybrid_risk_score({
    **application,
    'verified_income': verified_income,
    'verified_debt': actual_debt,
    'banking_stability': statement_data['income_metrics']['income_stability_score']
})
```
