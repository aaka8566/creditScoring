# 🎯 Bank Statement Processing - Complete Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### ✅ Created **ONE Unified API Endpoint**

**Before**: You had `/score` for regular scoring  
**After**: Same `/score` endpoint handles BOTH regular scoring AND bank statement processing

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **`bank_statement_processor.py`** (438 lines)
   - Extracts text from PDFs using PyPDF2
   - Extracts text from images using EasyOCR
   - Uses Ollama AI to analyze and structure financial data
   - Calculates income metrics and stability
   - Detects red flags (bounced checks, overdrafts, etc.)
   - Enriches loan applications with verified data

### 2. **`enhanced_main.py`** (Updated)
   - **ONE endpoint**: `/score`
   - Accepts JSON (backward compatible) OR Form data with file
   - Automatically processes bank statement if provided
   - Returns enhanced scoring with verification details
   - Includes Ollama AI explanations

### 3. Documentation Files
   - **`UNIFIED_API_GUIDE.md`** - Explains the unified endpoint concept

### 5. **`requirements.txt`** (Updated)
   - Added PyPDF2, EasyOCR, Pillow, opencv-python-headless

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Setup (One-time, 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# 2. Start Ollama
ollama serve

# 3. Download model (in new terminal)
ollama pull llama3.2

# 4. Install Python dependencies
cd /Users/macbook/Desktop/dvaraRepos/scoring
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Start your API
python enhanced_main.py
```

### Usage: Without Bank Statement (Your existing code works as-is!)

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/score",
    json={
        "age": 30,
        "income": 50000,
        "loan_amount": 500000,
        "employment_type": "Salaried",
        "credit_score": 720,
        "existing_debt": 100000
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Score: {result['enhanced_score']}")
# Result: Score: 45.2
```

### Usage: With Bank Statement (New feature!)

```python
import requests

with open('bank_statement.pdf', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/score",
        data={
            'age': 30,
            'income': 50000,
            'loan_amount': 500000,
            'employment_type': 'Salaried',
            'credit_score': 720,
            'existing_debt': 100000
        },
        files={'bank_statement': f}
    )

result = response.json()
print(f"Score: {result['enhanced_score']}")
print(f"Verified: {result['statement_verification']['verified']}")
print(f"Verified Income: {result['statement_verification']['verified_income']}")
# Result: 
# Score: 42.5
# Verified: True
# Verified Income: 48500
```

- ✅ **JPG/PNG** (Good) - Scanned statements, needs 300+ DPI
- ✅ **English & Hindi** text supported
- ✅ **1-10 pages**, 3 months recommended
- ✅ **Max 10MB** for PDFs, 5MB for images

## 🎯 What Gets Extracted

From the bank statement, Ollama extracts:

```json
{
  "account_holder_name": "Rajesh Kumar",
  "bank_name": "HDFC Bank",
  "monthly_income_estimate": 50000,
  "average_monthly_balance": 55000,
  "salary_credits": [50000, 50000, 50000],
  "loan_emi_payments": 12000,
  "bounced_transactions": 0,
  "cash_deposits": 5000,
  "financial_health_score": 85,
  "income_stability_score": 90,
  "red_flags": []  // or ["High cash deposits", etc.]
}
```

This data is then:
1. ✅ Used to verify declared income
2. ✅ Added to the credit scoring
3. ✅ Checked for red flags
4. ✅ Returned in the API response

## 🔄 Integration with Your Existing System

### Current System
```python
# main.py or enhanced_main.py
from enhanced_scoring import enhanced_hybrid_risk_score

@app.post("/score")
def score_loan(application: LoanApplication):
    result = enhanced_hybrid_risk_score(application.dict())
    return result
```

### Enhanced System (Now)
```python
# enhanced_main.py (updated)
from bank_statement_processor import get_processor

@app.post("/score")
async def score_loan(
    application: Optional[LoanApplication] = None,
    bank_statement: Optional[UploadFile] = File(None),
    age: Optional[int] = Form(None),
    # ... other form fields
):
    # Automatically handles both JSON and Form data
    # Processes bank statement if provided
    # Returns enhanced result
    pass
```

**Your existing JSON API calls continue to work exactly as before!**
